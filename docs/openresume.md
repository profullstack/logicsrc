# OpenResume.md

A resume is a Markdown file. That is the whole idea.

Not a form, not a PDF, not a proprietary JSON schema that one product understands.
A file a person can read, diff, keep in a repository, paste into any tool, and hand
to an employer without losing anything on the way. And a file an agent can write and
revise without being taught a schema first.

This document describes the convention. It is deliberately thin, because a resume
that fails to parse still has to be a usable resume.

## The shape

```markdown

## The rules

There are six, and every one of them degrades rather than fails.

**1. One `#` heading, and it is the person's name.** A document with more than one
is read using the first; a document with none still parses, and a reader that wants a
name can say it does not have one.

**2. The bullet list directly under the name is the contact block.** Each item is
`Key: value`, with or without `**bold**` on the key, or a bare `[label](url)`. Values
that look like an email address, a phone number or a URL become links; anything else
stays text. Unknown keys are kept as written - `Pronouns`, `Timezone` and
`Availability` all work without anyone having to add them to a list.

**3. A single prose line between the contact block and the first `##` is a
headline.** One line. More than one, and only the first is treated that way.

**4. `##` opens a section.** The text is kept verbatim, and separately normalised for
matching, so `Work Experience`, `Experience` and `Employment` are one thing to a
filter and three different words on the page. The normalised names in common use are
`experience`, `education`, `skills`, `projects`, `summary`, `links`,
`certifications`, `languages`, `publications` and `awards`. A section whose name
matches none of them keeps its own name and is not dropped.

**5. `###` opens an entry within a section: a job, a degree, a project.** A `|` in
the heading splits it into a title and a place - `Company | Berlin`. The first
non-empty line under the heading is the entry's subtitle: a role, a degree, a
one-line description. If that line ends in a bracketed range, the range is read out
of it:

```
Chief Programmer (1842 - 1843)
Staff Engineer (Mar 2020 - Present)
Contractor (2019 to 2021)
```

Hyphens, en dashes and em dashes are all accepted, because all three appear in real
resumes. `Present`, `Now`, `Current` and `Ongoing` mark a current role. Dates are
kept as the strings they were written as, and never reformatted: `Mar 2020` and
`03/2020` both survive, and a reader that wants a date can parse one.

**6. Bullets under an entry are its highlights.** Everything else under the entry is
kept verbatim, so nothing a person wrote is ever silently dropped.

## What is deliberately absent

**No required fields.** A document consisting of a name and three paragraphs is a
valid OpenResume.md.

**No date format.** Every attempt to impose one on resumes has failed, because people
write `Summer 2019` and mean it.

**No schema version.** Readers ignore what they do not recognise. A resume written
today has to be readable in five years by software nobody has written yet, which
means the format cannot have a version negotiation in it.

**No structured skills taxonomy.** Skills are the lines people wrote. Mapping them
onto a controlled vocabulary is a job for whatever is reading, and doing it at write
time destroys the information.

## Sections a parser derives, not the author

A reader may compute a structured view - name, contact pairs, sections, entries with
parsed date ranges - and use it for search and filtering. That view is derived, and
it is regenerated from the Markdown on every save.

**The Markdown is the canonical copy.** If the structured view and the document
disagree, the document is right. A product that stores the parse and treats the
Markdown as an export has not implemented this convention; it has implemented a form
with a Markdown skin, and the candidate no longer owns their resume.

## Converting into it

PDF, DOCX and plain text can all be converted to Markdown, and none of the
conversions are perfect. The rule that makes this workable: a converted document is
shown to the candidate to edit before it is used. A conversion nobody checks is a
conversion nobody should trust.

The `agenticjobs` reference implementation converts `.docx` by reading
`word/document.xml` directly, and `.pdf` with `pdftotext -layout`. Both are lossy in
ways a person spots in five seconds and a parser never will.

## Why Markdown

Because the alternative formats each fail one of the audiences.

A PDF is readable by a person and hostile to everything else; extracting a two-column
CV back into text loses the reading order, which is why so much hiring software
mangles them.

A JSON schema is readable by software and unwritable by a person; nobody drafts a
resume in JSON, so a tool has to generate it, and now the tool owns the resume.

Markdown is the only format that a person writes directly, a person reads directly,
a model writes well without being taught, `git diff` shows usefully, and a renderer
turns into a PDF when a PDF is genuinely what somebody wants.
